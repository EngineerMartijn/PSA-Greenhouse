	@description = The PSA Greenhouse is a rigid greenhouse for growning fresh food, producing oxygen and clean water. It will do this by using waste water and CO2 to grow plants, these will produce oxygen, food and clean water. As a fertilizer waste will be used (this is called hydroponics). Opening the shutters allows the greenhouse to use sunlight in addition to the onboard lighting and reduce EC use. Designed by the legendary zzz. (Rated for up to 6 Kerbals)
