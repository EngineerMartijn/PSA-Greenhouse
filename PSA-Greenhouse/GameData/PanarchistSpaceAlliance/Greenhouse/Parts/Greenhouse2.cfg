	description =  The 3.75m PSA Greenhouse is a rigid greenhouse for growing fresh food by using recycled mulch and fertilizer to grow plants.  Can work on it's own as a natural compost-driven greenhouse, or in combination with an OKS Agroponics Module cultivator for even more food production.  Also includes a basic life support recycler. Designed by the legendary zzz.
